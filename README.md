# 🚨 Smart Intrusion Detection System (IoT Project)

This IoT project uses a **PIR sensor** to detect human motion and trigger a **real-time alert** using the **Blynk cloud platform**. The system also provides a **local visual alert** using an LED. It is fully simulated using **Wokwi** with an **ESP32** microcontroller.

## 📌 Project Objective

> To develop a Smart Intrusion Detection System using NodeMCU (ESP32), PIR sensor, and LED, with cloud-based alerts via Blynk.

---

## 🔧 Features

- 🔘 Motion detection using PIR sensor
- 💡 LED turns ON when motion is detected
- ☁️ Sends real-time alert to Blynk Cloud (simulated)
- 🧪 Fully simulated in Wokwi for testing

## 🛠️ Hardware Components

| Component     | Description                     |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| ESP32         | Microcontroller (used instead of NodeMCU) |
| PIR Sensor    | For human motion detection      |
| LED           | For visual alert                |
| Internet      | Required for real Blynk alerts  |

> 📝 **Note**: ESP8266 NodeMCU is not available in Wokwi, so **ESP32** is used — which is compatible and performs the same function.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. System initializes and connects to WiFi via Blynk.
2. PIR sensor continuously checks for motion.
3. If motion is detected:
   - LED turns ON
   - Serial Monitor prints “Motion Detected!”
   - Blynk event is triggered (`intrusion`)
4. If no motion is detected:
   - LED turns OFF
